# Projeto-Teste-Automatizado-Virtoo

Introduction:

Virtoo is an end-to-end testing framework built with Cypress that allows you to automate your web application testing process. Virtoo is designed to be easy to set up and use, allowing you to quickly create and run tests for your web application.

Getting Started:

To get started with Virtoo, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you have those installed, you can simply run the following command to install Virtoo:

npm install virtoo --save-dev
Once you have Virtoo installed, you can start writing tests for your web application. Virtoo provides a simple and intuitive API that allows you to interact with your web application and perform various actions.

Example Usage:

Here is an example of how you can use Virtoo to test a login page:

import { login } from 'virtoo';

describe('Login', () => {
  it('should login successfully', () => {
    login('username', 'password');
    cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard');
  });
});

In this example, we import the login function from Virtoo and use it to simulate a user logging into the application with a username and password. We then use Cypress to verify that the user has been redirected to the dashboard page after logging in.

Conclusion:

Virtoo is a powerful testing framework that makes it easy to write and run end-to-end tests for your web application. With its intuitive API and ease of use, Virtoo can help you save time and catch bugs before they make it to production. So if you're looking for an easy-to-use testing framework for your web application, give Virtoo a try!
